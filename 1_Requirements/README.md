# Requirments
## Introduction
* A smoke detector is a device that senses smoke, typically as an indicator of fire.Detectors may use one or both sensing methods. Sensitive alarms can be used to detect and deter smoking in banned areas. Smoke detectors in large commercial and industrial buildings are usually connected to a central fire alarm system.This will help people to detect fire.This following application will help people to detect fire. 
## Research
* When we apply bias to the sensor, it takes some time for the sensor to warm, after that the electrochemical sensor detects specific Gas and varies the current flow through the sensor. Hence we get analog output ranges depends on Gas concentration.

It has 6 pins in all.The centre has two pins which are called the H pins (Heater pins).The other pins up and down pairs are known as A and B pins. Both pins are connected with separate sensors.

Both A pins are connected to the +5 DC voltage, both B pins are connected to the Analog Output pins of the Arduino and one H pin to the ground while another H pin to +5 DC voltage. We can vary the sensitivity of the sensor by connecting a resistor between ground and a B pin. So we can control the sensitivity of the detector by changing the resistance

## Advantages
* Decreased Risk Of Fire Damage.
* Round-The-Clock Monitoring.

## Disadvantages
* Very sensitive, which can lead to false alarms.
* Battery replacement.
# 4W'S & 1H
## Who
* Almost in places like houses,hospitals,schools.
## What
* This is particularly used to detect fire and mostly vapourised content.
## When
* This is used when there's some kind of fire accidents.
## Where
* Hospitals,Houses,Old age homes,Educational institues.
## How
* The usage of this project is very simple as it is an input output application.When the sensor detect the gas it rib=ngs the buzzer using audio output.
