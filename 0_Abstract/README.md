# Abstract
A Smoke Detector is a fire protection device that automatically detects smoke/gases and also gives us warning to be aware of it, with some protection system to handle the situation. Many fire accident occurs in our surrounding due to absence of human in the right place at the right time.
Smoke detectors are usually housed in plastic enclosures, typically shaped like a disk about 150 millimetres (6 inches) in diameter and 25 millimetres (1 inches) thick, but shape and size vary. Smoke can be detected either optically (photoelectric) or by physical process (ionization). Detectors may use one or both sensing methods. Sensitive alarms can be used to detect and deter smoking in banned areas. Smoke detectors in large commercial and industrial buildings are usually connected to a central fire alarm system. Domestic smoke detectors range from individual battery-powered units to several interlinked units with battery backup. With interlinked units, if any of them detects smoke, all of the alarms will trigger. This happens even if household power has gone out.The risk of dying in a residential fire is cut in half in houses with working smoke detectors
